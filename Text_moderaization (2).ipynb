        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "The proliferation of online content necessitates effective methods for detecting and moderating harmful language. This project addresses the challenge of classifying online comments. This is formulated as a **multi-label classification problem**, where each comment can belong to zero, one toxicity categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "Automated toxic comment detection is crucial for maintaining healthy online communities, preventing cyberbullying, and reducing the burden on human moderators. Building accurate and robust models contributes significantly to platform safety and user well-being.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### Libraries\n",
        "We will primarily use the following libraries:\n",
        "- `pandas` for data manipulation.\n",
        "- `numpy` for numerical operations.\n",
        "- `scikit-learn` for splitting data and evaluation metrics.\n",
        "- `torch` (or `tensorflow`) as the deep learning framework.\n",
        "- `transformers` by Hugging Face for accessing pre-trained models (BERT) and tokenizers.\n",
